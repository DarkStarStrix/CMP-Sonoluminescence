## Project Title
Quantum Simulation of Sonoluminescence: Modeling Water Molecules in a Harmonic Trap and Exploring Cavitation Dynamics with Qiskit Chemistry

## Overview
This project leverages Qiskit Chemistry, a quantum computing framework, to simulate the quantum dynamics of water molecules in a harmonic trap. The simulation explores the cavitation process, shedding light on the emission of short bursts of light from imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound.
